# Fixed Inconsistencies - https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fixed-inconsistencies/

This github repository was created mainly so I can keep better track of suggestions and bugs

You can suggest or report a bug by opening a new issue in Issues

Fixed Inconsistencies only supports the latest release of Minecraft. The only mod Fi supports is the latest release of OptiFine.

Leaving an Issue:
------------------------------
- Don't mark priority on anything (Don't use low, normal or high tags). I will be deciding the level of priority myself.
- If an issue is marked as added or fixed but is not in the latest release, it will be in the next one.

------------------------------
BUGS:
- Your bug will be marked invalid/wontfix if it cannot be reproduced, it isn't a problem relating to this pack or if it is intended
- Bugs can be:
    Missed Textures and Inconsistencies, Texturing Errors, Unnecessary Files within Pack, Typos in Description and Outdated Preview Images on PMC
- Bugs that are not caused by Fixed Inconsistencies should be labeled as ideas. Also if it hasn't been reported yet, please report the bug to Mojang at https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa 
- Describe your bug in detail, include image of the bug if possible and especially if a text description can't visualize the problem well enough
- Specify what platform you are on (Java or bedrock)
- If nessessary, include game version and version of pack you are using.
    - Any version of Fi that is not the latest is not supported. Check if your issue persists in the latest release.
    - Old versions of Minecraft and Optifine are not supported so check if the bug is present in the latest release.
------------------------------
SUGGESTIONS:
- Your suggestion will be marked invalid/wontfix if it strays too far from vanilla, is not an inconsistency or is impossible to add.
- When looking for inconsistencies, look for:
    Outdated Textures, Mismatched Textures, Texture Bugs, Illogical textures, Mixels (Mixed Pixel Resolutions, anything that isn't 16x), Inconsistent Uniformity (ex: textures of the same type having inconsistent shading, a couple ores have unique shapes but the rest are the same)
