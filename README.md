# Fixed Inconsistencies - https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fixed-inconsistencies/
  This is a large tweak pack that aims to update old textures to the Jappa style, fix textures that make no sense, fix texture bugs and add some quality of life as well. Minecraft is filled with a ton of inconsistencies like: Outdated Textures, Mismatched Textures, Mixels (different pixel resolutions put together), Texturing Bugs, Inconsistent Uniformity (ex: inconsistent shading, leather colors) and Textures that don't Make Sense (ex: powered rails having iron on them, blocks not having proper bottom textures). I aim to preserve Minecraft's current art style with this pack to make the textures look right at home in vanilla.
