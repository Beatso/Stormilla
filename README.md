# Fixed Inconsistencies - https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fixed-inconsistencies/

This github repository was created mainly so I can keep better track of suggestions and bugs

You can suggest or report a bug by opening a new issue in Issues

Fixed Inconsistencies only supports the latest release of Minecraft. The only mod Fi supports is the latest release of OptiFine.

If you need to contact Storm, you can do so through Discord: StormDragon77#0675 or PMC: StormDragon77. Discord will get you a faster reply. Either way, I should see it within a day.

Leaving an Issue:
------------------------------
- If an issue is marked as added or fixed but is not in the latest release, it will be in the next one.

------------------------------
BUGS:
- Your bug will be marked invalid/declined if it cannot be reproduced, it isn't a problem relating to this pack or if it is intended
- Bugs can be:
    Missed Textures and Inconsistencies, Texturing Errors, Unnecessary Files within Pack, Typos in Description and Outdated Preview Images on PMC
- Bugs that are not caused by Fixed Inconsistencies should be labeled as ideas. Also if it hasn't been reported yet, please report the bug to Mojang at https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa 
- Describe your bug in detail, include image of the bug if possible and especially if a text description can't visualize the problem well enough
- Specify what platform you are on (Java or bedrock)
- If nessessary, include game version and version of pack you are using.
    - Any version of Fi that is not the latest is not supported. Check if your issue persists in the latest release.
    - Old versions of Minecraft and Optifine are not supported so check if the bug is present in the latest release.
------------------------------
SUGGESTIONS:
- Your suggestion will be marked invalid/declined if it strays too far from vanilla, is not an inconsistency or is impossible to add.
- When looking for inconsistencies, I am lookking for 6 things:
    Outdated Textures, Mismatched Textures, Texture Bugs, Illogical textures, Mixels (Mixed Pixel Resolutions, anything that isn't 16x), Inconsistent Uniformity (a group of blocks/items should either all be uniform or not at all. Ex: dyes, ores)
- Please don't request adding other people's assets. Most of the time the answer is no, I like making the assets myself. You can however request an idea from another pack that you like and I might do my own spin on it.
- Suggestions that are not possible to add as far as I know: changing sounds of certain blocks, changing armor models (even with optifine)
